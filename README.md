# Task1_HousePricePredictions

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features. 
The model is developed using Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library, with a specific emphasis on the Support Vector Machine algorithm for predictive modeling.

Features are 
MSZoning: General zoning classification of the sale. (Categorical)
LotArea: Lot size in square feet. (Numerical)
LotConfig: Configuration of the lot. (Categorical)
BldgType: Type of dwelling. (Categorical)
OverallCond: Overall condition rating of the house. (Numerical)
YearBuilt: Original construction year. (Numerical)
YearRemodAdd: Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling). (Numerical)
Exterior1st: Exterior covering on the house. (Categorical)
BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 finished square feet. (Numerical)
TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area. (Numerical)
